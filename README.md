## Notice

- **I am not allowing people to just take my code without any notice and no reason. I am allowing people to take my code if they want only if they have my little permission if so. But I am actually putting my time on those things and you cannot just take all my code because you want to. I am only giving you a command or a bit of code for help but that's all.**

# Lito

<img align=right height=125 src=.github/f5a3d8aa3d1ee5333c23b0416c7e52ca.png>

Hi there! I am a personal bot on a 7 android Huawei that runs on Termux which is a app on android.
There is no invite link, so don't bother to search for one. I am sorry.

Lito has no many commands so there won't be much things to look in this github repo.
The current commands for Lito (those who are curious) is:
  - dadjoke:      `Says a dad joke. 2 second cooldown.`
  - feedback:     `A command that sends feedback to the owner. 150 second cooldown.`
  - guildinfo:    `Shows information about the server. 5 second cooldown.`
  - hownonce:     `How much of an nonce he is? 2 second cooldown with 4 tries.`
  - random:       `Chooses a random user. 5 second cooldown.`
  - userinfo:     `Shows information about the user. 5 second cooldown.`
  - stats/info: `Shows the stats about the bot. 5 second cooldown.`

## Another notice

   - **Some things are from their rightful owners, do not question me about them. They will receive the credits in the files in this github repo.**
