Hi there! I am a personal bot on an android that has linux installed on it and this bot will be in future testing things until Vito comes 100% self-hosted, there will be tests here so nothing intresting here! You can check vito here, https://github.com/Cristy86/Vito

# Notice

- I am not allowing people to just take my code without any notice and no reason. I am allowing people to take my code if they want only if they have my little permission if so. But I am actually putting my time on those things and you cannot just take all my code because you want to. I am only giving you a command or a bit of code for help but that's all.

- If you need to contact me, this is my discord: c_ristian#0126
